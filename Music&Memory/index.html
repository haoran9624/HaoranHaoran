  <h3>Research Question</h3>
  
<div class="col-lg-0 col-12 pt-lg-3 mb-4 pl-lg-7 px-lg-0 px-4 portfolio-content">
  <p>How can we store our memory with music and how can music shape our memory?</p>
  <img class="img-fluid project-img" src="/HaoranHaoran//images/qicon.png"></img>
  <br>
  <p>We store our memory in our brain, in our notebooks, in our computers or cellphones, sometimes even in othersâ€™ memory. But what if we use music to store our memory? Why people could clearly remember the melody and lyrics of a song they've listened to many years ago? Why a song always makes a people recall a piece of memory? why music is eazier than other things to be remembered by the Alzheimer's?</p>

  <h3>How Human's Brain Remember Music</h3>
  
<div class="col-lg-0 col-12 pt-lg-3 mb-4 pl-lg-7 px-lg-0 px-4 portfolio-content">
  <p>Musical memory entails the neural encoding of musical experiences. Studies support the hypothesis that temporal lobes are included in a musical memory network. However, musical memory seems not to rely solely on temporal lobe networks, a conclusion supported by evidence that recognition of a musical piece by a patient with bilateral temporal lobe lesion was enhanced by repeated exposure.</p>
  <p>It is likely that neural encoding of musical experiences is accomplished by more than one brain network. Attempts are often made to characterize musical memory in terms of established memory categories such as episodic/semantic, short-term/long-term, implicit/explicit, which are generally considered to be supported by different anatomical brain networks.</p>

  <h3>Why people with neurodegenerative disease still preserve the memory of music</h3>
  
<div class="col-lg-0 col-12 pt-lg-3 mb-4 pl-lg-7 px-lg-0 px-4 portfolio-content">
  <p>The regions in brain identified to encode musical memory corresponded to areas that showed substantially minimal cortical atrophy (as measured with magnetic resonance imaging), and minimal disruption of glucose-metabolism (as measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography), as compared to the rest of the brain.However, amyloid-Î² deposition (as measured with 18F-flobetapir positron emission tomography) within the currently observed regions of interest was not substantially less than in the rest of the brain, which suggests that the regions of interest were still in a very early stage of the expected course of biomarker development in these regions (amyloid accumulation â†’ hypometabolism â†’ cortical atrophy) and therefore relatively well preserved.

  <h3>Questionnaire Survey</h3>
  
<div class="col-lg-0 col-12 pt-lg-3 mb-4 pl-lg-7 px-lg-0 px-4 portfolio-content">
  <p>I designed a questionnaire to generally understand how people store their memory and how music plays a role in their memory.
</p>
  <br>
  <p>Sample size: 41</p>
  <img class="img-fluid project-img" src="/HaoranHaoran//images/qn.jpg"></img>
  <br>
  <p>People prefer to record memory by writing blog and taking pictures or videos. Besides, different people have different habits of storing their memory.</p>

  <br>
  <p>When people were asked to listen to again a song they listened to many years ago, they gave me these feedback.

  <h4>Interview 1</h4>
  <p>ðŸ‘‰ Ask the interviewee to feel free to sing a song that now comes to his or her mind.</p>
  <p>ðŸ‘‰ Question: How this song came to you mind?</p>
  <p>ðŸ‘‰ Play a song to the interviewee which was frequently answered in the questionnaire.</p>
  <p>ðŸ‘‰ Ask the feeling of the interviewee.</p>
